💻 Laptop Request Catalog Item – ServiceNow Project
📌 Project Overview

The Laptop Request Catalog Item project is designed to automate and streamline the process of requesting laptops within an organization using ServiceNow Service Catalog. The traditional manual request process is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. This project replaces it with a dynamic, user-friendly, and automated solution, ensuring faster processing, accurate data collection, and better user experience.
